# In Silico Biology: Comprehensive Study & Revision Guide

**Motto:** "Turning Biological Data into Knowledge, One Algorithm at a Time."

*The material here is based on the syllabus of the course **In Silico Biology** offered at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi for students pursuing B.Tech. Information Technology and Mathematical Innovations.*

## Introduction: What is In Silico Biology?

In Silico Biology (often used interchangeably with Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, though nuances exist) refers to the use of computational and statistical techniques to analyze biological data. It involves:

*   **Storing & Organizing Data:** Managing vast amounts of biological information (sequences, structures, expression data).
*   **Analyzing Data:** Developing and applying algorithms to find patterns, relationships, and insights.
*   **Modeling Biological Systems:** Simulating biological processes to understand their dynamics.

**Relevance (tying into QP1):**
*   **Modern Genomics is Dependent on Bioinformatics:** The sheer volume of data generated by high-throughput sequencing (Next-Generation Sequencing - NGS) would be meaningless without bioinformatics tools to:
    *   Assemble genomes from short sequence reads.
    *   Identify genes and regulatory elements.
    *   Compare genomes across species (comparative genomics).
    *   Analyze variations (SNPs, INDELs) and link them to diseases.
    *   Study transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) and proteomes.
*   **Computational Biology is Defining Recent Biological Advances:**
    *   **Drug Discovery & Design:** Identifying drug targets, designing new drugs, and predicting their efficacy/toxicity.
    *   **Personalized Medicine:** Tailoring treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup.
    *   **Understanding Complex Diseases:** Unraveling the genetic and molecular basis of diseases like cancer.
    *   **Evolutionary Biology:** Reconstructing evolutionary histories and understanding the forces driving evolution.
    *   **Synthetic Biology:** Designing and constructing new biological parts, devices, and systems.

## Unit I: Handling Protein and DNA Sequences

### 1.1 Sequence Fundamentals: DNA & Proteins

*   **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):**
    *   Composed of nucleotides: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C).
    *   Carries genetic information.
    *   Typically double-stranded helix.
*   **Proteins:**
    *   Composed of amino acids (20 common types).
    *   Perform a vast array of functions in the cell (enzymes, structural components, signaling molecules).
    *   Sequence of amino acids (primary structure) determines its 3D structure and function.

### 1.2 Sequence File Formats

Common formats for storing sequence data:

*   **FASTA (`.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fna`, `.faa`):**
    *   Most common format for sequence data.
    *   Begins with a single-line description (header line), starting with `>` (greater-than symbol).
    *   The rest of the header line is arbitrary but often contains identifiers and descriptions.
    *   Followed by lines of sequence data (nucleotides or amino acids).
    *   Can contain multiple sequences, each with its own header.
    *   *Example:*
        ```fasta
        >P01013 GENE X - Homo sapiens
        MTEITAAMVKELRESTGAGMMDCKNALSETNGDFDKAVQLLREKGLGKAAKKADRLAAEG
        LVSVKVSDDFTIAAMRPSYLSYEDLDMTFVENEYKALVAELEKENEERRRLKDPNKPEHK
        IPQFASRKGYLKSSEXALGXLIHEVLPLIPXXXXXQEPATFFTRELFVASRXFPFCVEYEPEARQ
        >sequence2 description
        ATGCGTAGCATCGATCG...
        ```
*   **GenBank (`.gb`, `.gbk`):**
    *   Rich format used by NCBI, containing sequence data and extensive annotation (features, source organism, literature references).
    *   More complex structure with specific fields (LOCUS, DEFINITION, ACCESSION, VERSION, FEATURES, ORIGIN, etc.).
*   **Other formats:** EMBL (similar to GenBank, used by EMBL-EBI), PDB (for 3D structural data).

### 1.3 Sequence Patterns, Motifs, and Profiles

*   **Sequence Pattern:** A short, exact sequence or a sequence with defined ambiguities that is conserved and has biological significance. Often represented using regular expressions.
    *   *Example:* `A-T-G-C-[GA]-N-C` (where N is any base, [GA] is G or A).
*   **Sequence Motif:** A short, conserved sequence pattern that is associated with a specific function or structural feature. Often discovered by looking for over-represented patterns in related sequences.
    *   *Examples:* Transcription factor binding sites (e.g., TATA box), glycosylation sites in proteins (e.g., N-X-S/T where X is not P).
    *   **Motif and Promoter Searches (from QP3):**
        *   **Promoter:** A DNA region upstream of a gene where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
        *   **Promoter Searches:** Involve identifying characteristic motifs within promoter regions (e.g., TATA box, CAAT box, GC box for eukaryotes; -10 Pribnow box and -35 box for prokaryotes).
        *   **Motif Searches:** Use algorithms to find known motifs (e.g., PROSITE patterns) or discover new ones in a set of sequences (e.g., MEME suite). Databases like JASPAR or TRANSFAC store transcription factor binding motifs.
*   **Sequence Profile (or Position-Specific Scoring Matrix - PSSM):** A more quantitative representation of a motif or conserved region. It's a matrix where each row represents a position in the motif and each column represents a character (nucleotide or amino acid). The matrix cells contain scores indicating the likelihood (or frequency) of finding a particular character at a specific position.
    *   Generated from a multiple sequence alignment of related sequences.
    *   More sensitive than simple patterns for detecting distantly related sequences.
    *   Used in tools like PSI-BLAST.

### 1.4 Sequence Similarity, Identity, Homology, and Evolutionary Relationships

*   **Identity:** The percentage of characters (nucleotides or amino acids) that are identical between two aligned sequences at corresponding positions.
    *   *Example:*
        ```
        Seq1: A T G C G
        Seq2: A T A C G
        Identical positions: 1, 2, 4, 5. Length = 5. Identity = (4/5) * 100 = 80%.
        ```
*   **Similarity:** The percentage of characters that are "similar" between two aligned sequences. For proteins, similarity accounts for conservative substitutions (e.g., Leucine (L) and Isoleucine (I) are chemically similar). Requires a scoring matrix to define similarity.
*   **Homology:** An inference that two sequences share a common evolutionary ancestor. **It's a qualitative statement (yes/no), not quantitative.** High sequence identity/similarity often *suggests* homology, but homology is an evolutionary conclusion.
    *   **Homologues:** Sequences that are homologous.
        *   **Orthologues:** Homologous sequences in *different species* that arose from a single ancestral gene during a speciation event. They usually retain the same function.
            *   *Example:* Alpha-globin in humans and alpha-globin in chimpanzees.
        *   **Paralogues:** Homologous sequences *within the same species* that arose from a gene duplication event. They may have evolved new (but often related) functions.
            *   *Example:* Alpha-globin and beta-globin in humans.
        *   **Xenologues:** Homologous sequences that arose from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between different species.
            *   *Example:* Antibiotic resistance genes transferred between bacterial species.

### 1.5 Scoring Matrices (Crucial for Alignment & QP5)

Scoring matrices assign a score for aligning any possible pair of characters (residues or nucleotides).

*   **Purpose:** To quantify the likelihood of one character substituting for another during evolution, or simply the similarity between them.
*   **For Nucleic Acids:**
    *   Simpler than protein matrices.
    *   Often a simple **match/mismatch** scheme.
        *   *Match score:* Positive (e.g., +1 or +5).
        *   *Mismatch score:* Negative (e.g., -1 or -3) or zero.
    *   Transitions (purine to purine A<->G, or pyrimidine to pyrimidine C<->T) might be scored differently from transversions (purine to pyrimidine) as transitions are evolutionarily more frequent.
*   **For Proteins (PAM & BLOSUM Series - QP5):** More complex due to 20 amino acids with varying physicochemical properties and substitution frequencies.
    *   **PAM (Point Accepted Mutation) / Dayhoff Matrices:**
        *   **Derivation:** Based on an evolutionary model. Developed by Margaret Dayhoff.
            *   Started with closely related protein sequences (at least 85% identity) aligned globally.
            *   Counted the number of observed mutations (accepted point mutations) for each amino acid pair.
            *   Calculated mutation probabilities.
            *   **PAM1 matrix:** Represents 1% amino acid change (1 accepted mutation per 100 residues), or an evolutionary distance of 1 PAM unit. It describes probabilities of one amino acid changing to another *if only 1% of residues were to change*.
            *   **Higher PAM matrices (PAM120, PAM250):** Extrapolated from PAM1 by multiplying the PAM1 matrix by itself N times (e.g., PAM250 = PAM1<sup>250</sup>). PAM250 is suitable for detecting distant homologues.
        *   **Principle:** Higher PAM numbers (e.g., PAM250) are for comparing more distantly related sequences, while lower numbers (e.g., PAM30) are for closely related ones.
        *   **Log-odds scores:** The final matrices contain log-odds scores, where the score is `log(observed frequency of substitution / expected frequency of substitution if random)`.
    *   **BLOSUM (Blocks Substitution Matrix):**
        *   **Derivation:** Based on empirical data from conserved blocks of aligned protein sequences (without gaps) from the BLOCKS database. Developed by Henikoff and Henikoff.
            *   Sequences within blocks are clustered based on identity percentage.
            *   Substitutions are counted *only* between sequences that are more divergent than a certain clustering threshold.
            *   **BLOSUM_X_:** The X indicates the maximum identity percentage used for clustering. For example, for **BLOSUM62**, sequences within a block that are ≥62% identical are clustered into a single representative sequence, and substitutions are counted between these representatives or less similar sequences. This reduces bias from over-represented closely related sequences.
            *   Directly calculates log-odds scores from these observed frequencies.
        *   **Principle:** Lower BLOSUM numbers (e.g., BLOSUM45) are for comparing more distantly related sequences, while higher numbers (e.g., BLOSUM80, BLOSUM90) are for closely related ones. This is *opposite* to PAM. **BLOSUM62 is a good general-purpose matrix.**
    *   **PAM vs. BLOSUM:**
        *   **PAM:** Based on an explicit evolutionary model and extrapolation from closely related sequences. Prone to errors in extrapolation for distant relationships.
        *   **BLOSUM:** Derived from more diverse, directly observed local alignments of conserved regions. Generally performs better for detecting weaker similarities and local alignments.

*   **How scoring matrices differ for nucleic acids and proteins (QP5):**
    *   **Alphabet Size:** 4 (NA) vs. 20 (AA).
    *   **Chemical Similarity:** NA bases are generally treated as distinct or in simple match/mismatch. Amino acids have varying physicochemical properties (size, charge, hydrophobicity), so some substitutions are more conservative (less disruptive to structure/function) than others and are scored more favorably.
    *   **Evolutionary Pressure:** Proteins often have more nuanced evolutionary constraints due to structure and function.
    *   **Degeneracy of Genetic Code:** Different codons can code for the same amino acid. This means DNA can change without the protein changing (silent mutation). This isn't directly reflected in simple NA matrices but is an underlying evolutionary principle.

*   **Significance & Use (QP5):**
    *   Essential for sequence alignment algorithms to find optimal alignments.
    *   Quantify the similarity between sequences.
    *   Help infer homology by providing a statistical basis for similarity scores.
    *   Different matrices are suited for different evolutionary distances.

### 1.6 Sequence Alignment

The process of arranging two or more sequences to identify regions of similarity, which may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.

*   **Pairwise Sequence Alignment (PSA):** Alignment of two sequences.
    *   **Applications:**
        *   Inferring homology.
        *   Identifying functional domains or motifs.
        *   Predicting protein structure/function.
        *   Primer design for PCR.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Global Alignment (from QP1):**
            *   Attempts to align the *entire length* of both sequences, from end to end.
            *   Suitable for comparing sequences that are expected to be similar over their entire length (e.g., orthologues).
            *   **Algorithm:** Needleman-Wunsch (uses dynamic programming).
            *   Can introduce gaps (insertions/deletions) to maximize overall alignment score. Gap penalties (gap opening penalty, gap extension penalty) are used.
        *   **Local Alignment (from QP1):**
            *   Identifies the *region(s) of highest similarity* between two sequences, which may be short segments.
            *   Suitable for finding conserved domains within otherwise divergent sequences, or comparing sequences of different lengths.
            *   **Algorithm:** Smith-Waterman (uses dynamic programming).
            *   More flexible than global alignment.
        *   **Key Differences: Global vs. Local (QP1):**

            | Feature         | Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)         | Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman)          |
            | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
            | **Goal**        | Align entire sequences, end-to-end.         | Find best matching sub-regions.           |
            | **Suitability** | Similar length, overall similarity expected. | Dissimilar sequences, different lengths, domain searching. |
            | **Score**       | Can be negative (no negative cell scores in matrix initialization in classic DP). | Only positive scores considered; path can start/end anywhere. Cell scores cannot go below zero. |
            | **Traceback**   | Starts from bottom-right corner of DP matrix. | Starts from highest scoring cell in DP matrix. |
            | **Output**      | One overall alignment for both full sequences. | One or more best local alignments.        |

    *   **Algorithms Commonly Used for Alignment (QP1):**
        *   **Dynamic Programming:** Needleman-Wunsch (global), Smith-Waterman (local). Guaranteed to find optimal alignment but computationally intensive for very long sequences or many sequences.
        *   **Heuristic Algorithms:** BLAST, FASTA. Faster, approximate methods for database searches.

*   **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):** Alignment of three or more sequences.
    *   **Concept:** Aims to arrange a set of sequences to highlight conserved regions and variations. More informative than pairwise alignment for understanding family-wide conservation.
    *   **Applications:**
        *   Identifying conserved motifs and functional domains.
        *   Building phylogenetic trees.
        *   Predicting protein secondary/tertiary structure.
        *   Primer design for diverse targets.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Progressive Alignment:** Most common (e.g., ClustalW, ClustalOmega, MAFFT, T-Coffee).
            1.  Perform all possible pairwise alignments.
            2.  Use pairwise scores to construct a guide tree (dendrogram) showing sequence relatedness.
            3.  Align sequences progressively, following the branching order of the guide tree, starting with the most similar pairs.
        *   Iterative methods (e.g., MUSCLE)
        *   Consistency-based methods (e.g., T-Coffee)
    *   **Differentiating MSA and Pairwise Alignment (from QP6):**

        | Feature         | Pairwise Sequence Alignment                  | Multiple Sequence Alignment                     |
        | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
        | **No. Sequences**| Two                                          | Three or more                                   |
        | **Complexity**  | Simpler, computationally less intensive.      | More complex, computationally intensive.        |
        | **Primary Goal**| Assess similarity between two sequences.      | Identify conserved regions/motifs across a family. |
        | **Output**      | Single alignment of two sequences.            | Single alignment showing all sequences.           |
        | **Information** | Relationship between two sequences.           | Family-wide conservation, evolutionary patterns.  |
        | **Algorithms**  | Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, BLAST, FASTA. | ClustalW/Omega, MAFFT, MUSCLE, T-Coffee.        |

### 1.7 Phylogeny and Cladistics

*   **Phylogeny:** The study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms or sequences. Represented as a phylogenetic tree.
*   **Phylogenetic Tree (Dendrogram):** A diagrammatic representation of evolutionary relationships.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Nodes:** Represent taxonomic units (species, genes) or points of divergence (ancestors).
            *   **External nodes (leaves/tips):** Represent existing sequences/organisms.
            *   **Internal nodes:** Represent inferred common ancestors.
        *   **Branches (Edges):** Connect nodes; length can represent evolutionary distance (time or amount of genetic change).
        *   **Root:** The common ancestor of all sequences in the tree (if the tree is rooted). Unrooted trees show relationships but not the common ancestor.
    *   **Interpretation:** Sequences that are closer together on the tree are more closely related.
*   **Cladistics:** A specific method of phylogenetic analysis that classifies organisms/sequences based on shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies) that distinguish them from other groups.
*   **Phylogenetic Analysis Steps (General):**
    1.  **Sequence Selection:** Choose appropriate homologous sequences.
    2.  **Multiple Sequence Alignment:** Crucial step; alignments must be accurate.
    3.  **Model of Evolution Selection:** For DNA or protein, models correct for multiple substitutions at the same site.
    4.  **Tree Building Method:**
        *   **Distance-based:** UPGMA (simple, assumes constant molecular clock), Neighbor-Joining (NJ) (efficient, widely used).
        *   **Character-based:** Maximum Parsimony (finds tree with fewest evolutionary changes), Maximum Likelihood (ML) (finds tree that maximizes probability of observing the data given a model), Bayesian Inference (finds tree with highest posterior probability).
    5.  **Tree Evaluation:** Bootstrapping or other methods to assess the statistical confidence of branches.

*   **Differentiating Morphological-based and Molecular-based Phylogeny (from QP6):**

    | Feature             | Morphological-based Phylogeny                  | Molecular-based Phylogeny                      |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
    | **Data Source**     | Observable physical traits (anatomy, fossils).   | DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.                |
    | **Objectivity**     | Can be subjective in trait selection/coding.   | More objective, data is discrete characters.  |
    | **Scale**           | Often used for higher taxonomic levels, fossils. | Applicable across all life, including microbes, very deep evolutionary time. |
    | **Resolving Power** | May be limited for closely related species or organisms with few distinct traits. | Can resolve fine-scale relationships and deep divergences. |
    | **Challenges**      | Convergent evolution (analogous traits), loss of traits. | Horizontal gene transfer, varying rates of evolution, alignment artifacts. |
    | **Analysis Methods**| Parsimony-like reasoning, character matrices.  | Distance, Parsimony, Likelihood, Bayesian methods. |

### 1.8 Sequence Similarity Based Search Engines

*   **BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool):**
    *   **Purpose:** Fast heuristic algorithm for finding local alignments between a query sequence and sequences in a database.
    *   **How it Works (Simplified):**
        1.  **Seeding:** Breaks query into short "words" (e.g., 3 AAs for proteins, 11 NAs for DNA).
        2.  **Searching:** Finds exact or near-exact matches (hits) to these words in the database using an index.
        3.  **Extension:** Extends these high-scoring short hits in both directions, without gaps, until the score drops below a threshold. These are called High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs).
        4.  **Evaluation:** Calculates statistical significance (E-value) for HSPs. Significant HSPs may be joined if consistent.
    *   **Programs:**
        *   **BLASTN:** Nucleotide query vs. Nucleotide database.
        *   **BLASTP:** Protein query vs. Protein database.
        *   **BLASTX:** Translated nucleotide query (all 6 frames) vs. Protein database.
        *   **TBLASTN:** Protein query vs. Translated nucleotide database (all 6 frames).
        *   **TBLASTX:** Translated nucleotide query vs. Translated nucleotide database (computationally intensive).
    *   **Key Outputs:**
        *   **Score (Bit Score):** Normalized score that allows comparison between different alignments and scoring systems. Higher is better.
        *   **E-value (Expect Value):** The number of alignments with a score equal to or greater than the observed score that would be expected to occur by chance in a database of that size. Lower E-value is better (more significant). E-value close to 0 suggests a highly significant match.
*   **FASTA:**
    *   Another heuristic local alignment tool, older than BLAST.
    *   **How it Works (Simplified):**
        1.  Uses k-tups (similar to BLAST words) to find regions of identity.
        2.  Identifies regions with high density of k-tup matches.
        3.  Uses scoring matrix to score these regions.
        4.  Attempts to join regions using dynamic programming in a limited band.
    *   Generally slower but sometimes more sensitive than BLAST for distantly related DNA sequences.

*   **Pattern-based, Motif-based, Profile-based Searches:**
    *   **Pattern-based:** Searching databases using exact or degenerate patterns (e.g., ScanProsite for PROSITE patterns).
    *   **Motif-based:** Searching for occurrences of known sequence motifs.
    *   **Profile-based (PSSM-based):** More sensitive searches using profiles built from MSAs of related sequences (e.g., PSI-BLAST, HMMER). These can detect very distant homologues.

        | **Presence of Introns**| Yes                                   | No (for eukaryotes)                       |
        | **Applications**| Genome sequencing, gene structure studies. | Gene expression analysis, ORF cloning, protein production. |

*   **Transcriptomics and RNA Sequence Analysis (RNA-Seq):**
    *   Study of the transcriptome – the complete set of RNA transcripts (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA) in a cell/tissue at a specific time.
    *   **RNA-Seq:** A high-throughput sequencing technique to sequence cDNA derived from RNA. Allows quantification of gene expression levels, discovery of new transcripts, alternative splicing variants, and non-coding RNAs.
*   **Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences:**
    *   Sequencing of DNA directly from environmental samples (e.g., soil, water, gut) without culturing individual organisms.
    *   Provides insights into microbial diversity, community structure, and functional potential of unculturable organisms.

## Special Section: Answering QP4 (Protein Interactions)

**Q. 4. Discuss various types of protein interactions and name at least one technique for detecting each type of interactions. Describe and compare BioGRID and STRING, especially in terms of their purpose, database and unique information these provide. [8+7=15]**

**Part 1: Types of Protein Interactions and Detection Techniques (8 marks)**

Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are physical contacts established between two or more protein molecules as a result of biochemical events and/or electrostatic forces. They are crucial for virtually all cellular processes.

| Type of Interaction              | Description                                                                                                | Detection Technique(s)                                         |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Stable Physical Interactions** | Proteins form long-lasting complexes (e.g., components of ribosomes, proteasome, hemoglobin).               | **Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) + Mass Spectrometry (MS)** <br/> Affinity Purification coupled with Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS) |
| **2. Transient Physical Interactions** | Proteins interact briefly to mediate a specific event (e.g., enzyme-substrate, signaling protein-receptor). | **Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H)** <br/> Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) <br/> Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) / Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) (in vivo) |
| **3. Functional Interactions / Genetic Interactions** | Proteins that do not necessarily bind physically but are involved in the same pathway or biological process. Mutations in genes for these proteins might have synergistic or suppressive effects. | **Synthetic Lethality Analysis (SLA) / Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA)** <br/> Co-expression analysis (from transcriptomic data) <br/> Pathway analysis |
| **4. Protein-DNA Interactions**   | Proteins (e.g., transcription factors) binding to specific DNA sequences.                                 | **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq)** <br/> Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) <br/> DNA footprinting |
| **5. Protein-RNA Interactions**   | Proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, splicing factors) binding to RNA molecules.                           | **RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-Seq)** <br/> Cross-Linking and Immunoprecipitation (CLIP-Seq) |

*(Focus primarily on Protein-Protein interactions for this question, but Protein-DNA/RNA are also important interactions involving proteins).*

**Part 2: Comparison of BioGRID and STRING (7 marks)**

Both BioGRID and STRING are popular databases for exploring protein-protein interactions, but they differ in their scope and data sources.

| Feature                     | BioGRID (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets) | STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Purpose**         | To archive and disseminate experimentally validated genetic and protein interaction data from model organisms and humans. | To provide a comprehensive, quality-controlled view of protein-protein interactions, including both physical and functional associations. |
| **Data Sources**            | Primarily curated from published literature for experimentally determined interactions (physical and genetic). Relies on manual curation. | Integrates data from multiple sources: <br/> - Experimental data (physical interactions) <br/> - Curated databases (pathways, complexes) <br/> - Computational predictions (gene neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence) <br/> - Text mining (co-mention in literature) <br/> - Co-expression data <br/> - Homology-based transfers of interactions |
| **Scope of Interactions**   | Focuses on physical and genetic interactions.                       | Broader: includes direct physical interactions and indirect functional associations. |
| **Confidence Scoring**      | Provides details of experimental evidence for each interaction. Does not typically provide a single composite score but relies on evidence codes and publication counts. | Assigns a **confidence score** (0-1) to each interaction, derived from combining probabilities from different evidence channels. Higher scores indicate higher confidence. |
| **Unique Information Provided / Emphasis** | - Emphasis on detailed experimental evidence. <br/> - Strong support for genetic interactions. <br/> - Curates post-translational modifications (PTMs) influencing interactions. <br/> - Chemical interactions. | - Integrated view of direct and indirect interactions. <br/> - Powerful visualization of interaction networks with evidence channels shown. <br/> - Scores interactions by confidence. <br/> - Strong on comparative genomics (transfer of interactions across species). <br/> - Can show known/predicted 3D structures for interacting partners. |
| **Organism Coverage**       | Extensive for major model organisms and humans.                      | Very broad, covering thousands of organisms from all domains of life. |
| **User Interface**          | Provides search, download, and some visualization tools.         | Highly interactive network visualization, enrichment analysis tools, ability to add more interactors. |
| **When to Use**             | When needing high-confidence, experimentally verified interactions, especially genetic ones, with direct links to publications. | When wanting a comprehensive overview of potential functional partners, including predicted interactions, or when comparing interactions across many species. Useful for hypothesis generation. |

## General Exam Tips:

*   **Read Carefully:** Understand what the question is asking. Differentiate between "define," "compare," "describe," "elaborate."
*   **Structure Answers:** Use headings, bullet points, and tables (like above) where appropriate to make your answers clear and easy to read.
*   **Examples are Key:** Illustrate concepts with specific examples (e.g., name specific algorithms, databases, or file formats).
*   **QP Context:** Note the mark distribution (e.g., [3+2+5+5=15]). Allocate your time and depth of explanation accordingly.
*   **Keywords:** Use the correct terminology.
*   **Diagrams (If allowed & applicable):** Simple diagrams can sometimes explain concepts (e.g., a simple phylogenetic tree, a schematic of global vs. local alignment) more effectively than words alone. If not drawing, describe verbally.
*   **Be Concise but Complete:** Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, but don't omit crucial details.
*   **Review Syllabus and QP:** Make sure you've touched upon all major areas. Notice recurring themes (alignment, databases, PAM/BLOSUM were in multiple QP questions).
